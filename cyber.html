      <h2><i>February 15th: A strong start to the new year, and leaps in cybersecurity</i></h2>
      <b><i>Big server projects, winning SANS GSEC, and intense learning and skill development. Through hard work, I've made it this far.</i><b>
      <b><i>Working cybersecurity for the government? 5 certifications within a year? Through hard work, I'll get it done.</i><b>
          <p>
            It's been a busy 2-3 months! Lots of determined learning, improving, and honing of my skills while chasing a couple new opportunities.
            <br>
          <ol> <b>Highlighted Learning Projects of the Year (so far)</b>
            <li>Created an multi-layered defense for a "Data Backup and Hacking Operations Kali Linux SSH Server", accessible from the Internet, finished February 1st
            </li>
            <ul> SSH
              <li>Configured a non-standard SSH port, for resiliency against port scanning</li>
              <li>Only able to logon as a specific user, and NOT with a password (i.e., can't logon as admin, root, anonymous, etc., and can't login with a password [see next defense layer])</li>
              <li>Required to use 521-bit encrypted ECDSA-private key/identity file, with the password to decrypt it</li>
              <li>Applied principle of least privilege to the ssh account with group and user permissions, and disabled it from using 'su' (switching user accounts) with PAM (pluggable authentication modules) (<a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/64860">tutorial link</a>)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul> Storage Administration
              <li>Added a 2TB drive to my server</li>
              <li>Used parted to change file table from MFT to GPT (<a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-create-partition#ftoc-heading-1">here's a great tutorial on this)</a>)</li>
              <li>Used parted to make new disk partition, and added an NTFS file system to that partition</li>
              <li>Added an entry to /etc/fstab so it would automatically mount at boot. (Tutorials and Information <a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/etc-fstab">LINK-ONE</a>, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/38125/htg-explains-what-is-the-linux-fstab-and-how-does-it-work/">LINK-TWO</a>)</li>
              <li>To be troubleshooted: Execute permissions not allowed on (despite 'exec' flag in fstab)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Created a Corporate Virtual Client-Server Linux Network, from scratch (that's a mouthful)
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Installed AlmaLinux ISO, and installed the OS on several VMWare virtual computers. Finished earlier in the year.</li>
              <li>Network connectivity and troubleshooting with nmcli (no tools like netstat, nc, or even ifconfig [I used skinny, GUI-less 8GB ISO image to limit space])</li>
              <li>Installing and hardening SSH (disabling root, having an ssh user, nonstandard port, limited simultaneous session-count)</li>
              <li>Created several user accounts, groups, and folders to simulate department users/resources on a corporate network. Applied permissions and ACLs (access control lists, seen with getfacl and set with setfacl) to apply principle of least privilege. Made an Admin account that alone could use 'sudo', but still needed to use password authentication for privileged actions.</li>
              <li>Installed and hardened programs like Postfix mail and Apache Web Server (even using TLS encryption and firewalls to force port 443 and HTTPS connections only)</li>
              <li>Set password policies with PAM and /etc/login.defs because I like learning :) (note, login.defs is usually overwritten by PAM, but provides a backup policy with administration directly over the /etc/shadow file)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Learned Git for knowledge and periodically backing up my notes with a cloud version control system, rather than just dumping them into a cloud storage service every once and awhil</li>
            <li>Learned how to do file carving in a digital forensics class
            </li>
            <li>Learned how to do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Iu1cC7_zbE">network packet dissection by hand</a>
            </li>
            <li>Started a plan to get four certifications for the price of one (I spared you the details but this is the high-level plan):</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Do Google IT Support Professional Certificate Course (prepares me for CompTIA A+ and gives a certification)</li>
              <li>Do CompTIA A+, and <a href="https://www.credly.com/org/coursera/badge/google-comptia-dual-credential">earn the IT support Profession and A+ Dual Credential</a></li>
              <li>Do Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate Course (prepares me for CompTIA Security+ and gives a certification)</li>
              <li>Do CompTIA Security+, and </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Oh yeah, I also won access to SANS401: Network, Endpoint, and Cloud, which awards the DoD/U.S. Government Agency recognized GIAC GSEC, due to my awesome work in the Michigan Governor's High School Cyber Challenge on Cyberstart America (I already have the GFACT, so they gave me another SANS course)</li>
          </ol>
          <ol> <b>Opportunities in Progress</b>
            <li>DoD Cybersecurity Scholarship, will be getting a response in a few months</li>
            <li>SANS GSEC, going through the course and getting that credential</li>
            <li>NCL Webinars, to give me more training</li>
            <li>Mi pona e sona toki pona :)</li>
          </ol>

      <h2><i>October 31st & November 1st, 2023: The end of an EXTRAORDINARY Cybersecurity Awareness Month</i></h2>
      <b><i>Happy Halloween, y Feliz Día de los Muertos :)</i><b>
          <p>
            Ah, where to start? Summits, CTFs, career development, and and immense amount of learning and skill
            development...(don't worry, I'll keep it structured and semi-brief)
            <br>
          <ol> <b>Summits</b>
            <li>Davenport University's Cybersecurity Celebration (and a career fair earlier in the day) - October 12th
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>I learned that <i>the one set path in Cybersecurity is that there is no path </i> (but that actual
                work
                experience
                is important, and will "unlock" my other skills and experience in a sense). This was super enlightening
                as I
                learned about the different careers in Cybersecurity, and heard personal stories from professionals in
                the
                field.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The Novi, Michigan HS Cyber Summit- October 19th</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Shaking hands with people from all levels of the industry, state, federal, and private, picking locks
                with
                a guy from GrrCon, learning that imposter syndrome affects even the very best, and learning from a
                diverse
                range of knowledgable speakers (re-affirming that nobody
                questions the guy with the clipboard :) )
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <ol> <b>CTFs</b>
            <li>The National Cyber League's Fall 2023 Individual Game</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Putting my skills to the test in OSINT, Cryptography, Password Cracking, Log Analysis, Network Traffic
                Analysis, Forensics, Scanning & Reconnaissance, and Enumeration and Exploitation</li>
              <li>My highlights:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Phenomenal performance in Scanning & Reconnaissance, using NMAP, poking with Telnet, Port Knocking
                  (something new and interesting that I learned), listening with Tcpdump, or making sense of a large log
                  file with a capture</li>
                <img style="width: 45%; height: auto;" src="picture_files/cyber/october_2023/Port Knocking.PNG"></img>
                <li>Great work in OSINT, doing anything from finding super old TLS certificates, to finding the Serial
                  ID of
                  a singular tree in the middle of New York City based off of nothing but an image</li>

              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Cipher Tech's Reverse Engineering, Digital Forensics, and Binary Reversal CTF - (ONE OF MY BEST
              PERFORMANCES
              IN CYBERSECURITY)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This CTF provided a 32 and 64 bit binary of a "suspicious PC performance program", and the questions
                beforehand included things like "what is the exact OS and version that made this binary? How long does
                it
                stay dormant [there was a C sleep function of 2 days and 9 hours that I bypassed with something called
                "Dependency Injection", and then again later by manipulating memory addresses with the GNU Debugger]?
                What
                is the hostname [NOT IP ADDRESS, which would be easy with Wireshark] of the remote computer, and what
                data
                is being exfiltrated?". With only 5 questions, 14 days to complete the CTF, and NO idea where to even
                start,
                I was a little in over my head, BUT I was determined to use this as a learning experience to advance my
                super-limited knowledge in Digital Forensics and RE.</li>
              <li>Sure enough, this proved to be a SPECTACULAR learning experience:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>I spent two days learning Assembly, and going through NCL's "101 on Code Execution" to get some
                  foundational knowledge on Reverse Engineering before I even touched the CTF challenges. <a>link1</a>
                  <a>link2</a>
                </li>
                <li>Then, my third day, I spent a bunch of time, critical thinking brainpower, and coffee on solving
                  EVERY
                  challenge in
                  the CTF in a blaze of glory. I made leaps and bounds in Reverse Engineering, and through hours of
                  learning
                  methods to bypass the sleep function in the provided binary, combing through the binary and countless
                  memory addresses with GDB, using wireshark and miscellaneous forensics tools to find specific
                  information.
                </li>
                <li>Some screenshots of what I did:</li>
                <li>(From top to bottom: Using GDB to find out how long the binary lays dormant for. Then, Dependency
                  Injection to bypass the binary's sleep function, and then capturing the subsequent connect command
                  with wireshark. Next, displaying the GCC comment displaying what OS and version was used to compile
                  the binary (and verifying with ChatGPT to provide related information that made me sure of the answer
                  [the CTF records accuracy]). Next, using GDB to find and verify the hostname of the computer that the
                  program was trying to connect to. Finally, I used Ghidra [for the first time, made easier due to my
                  studying of assembly] to discover what data was being exfiltrated [this took a long time and combing
                  through practically EVERY line of Assembly, multiple-times-over, and I kind of guessed that
                  "keystrokes" were being sent because of the usage of /dev/input {which refers to keyboards and
                  computer input devices}], and got the correct answer)
              </ul>

              Website exploitation? Command injection? TryHackMe rooms? There's loads for me to learn, and I'll learn it

      <h2><i>September 26th and 27th, 2023: Blitzing to the Cyberstart Finish Line</i></h2>
      <p>
        These past two days, I decided to hit a <i>mega</i> sprint in these Cyberstart America/GHSCC CTF challenges.
        It's amazing what one can do in so little time (a classic example of the deadly mix of Parkinson's Law and
        Extreme Determination) :)
        <br><br>
        After thinking I had hit a brick wall, I solved just enough challenges in what was the current level to move on
        to the next level, and to my surprise, just kept solving challenge after challenge (and, being level 11 and 12
        out of
        13, the challenges were MUCH more difficult, realistic, and multifaceted than any of the previous ones [and I
        even solved some of them in unconventional directions than what the CTF was suggesting {when it still provided
        very light hints/suggestions as to where to look in the beginner-level field manual. The last half of the
        challenges in
        level 11, and all of them in level 12, did not contain ANY sort of hinting whatsoever}]), and then unlocked the
        <i>next</i> level, where I did the same thing until I was <i>finally</i> stopped in my cyber-slaughter of
        challenges (which was okay, because it was late at night on September 27th, the final day of the competition).
        Here is a highlight reel of what I did:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating several Buffer Overflows</li>
        <li>Fixing broken header hexes</li>
        <li>Steganography</li>
        <li>GNU Debugging (Proud Moment)</li>
        <li>Cookie Manipulation (doing anything from SQL Injections with a cookie to bruteforcing session cookies with
          scripting)</li>
        <li>Log analysis</li>
        <li>Fixing C and Assembly Code (and using quick and effective research skills)</li>
        <li>Scripting (Lots and Lots of Scripting, and creating bash or python programs to hack both programs and
          websites, unencrypt messages, and other brute forcing)</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br> Debugging a program and analyzing memory spaces to find the password:<br>

      Quick Bash Script that takes a large number of encrypted passwords and pipes them into a program to find the right
      one<br>

      <br><br>
      After jumping up to 97,500 points, do you think I'm in the top 10, and off to the final competition at the Cyber
      Summit on October 18th? :)

      <br>----------------------------------------
      <br>This was a super simple but cheeky-feeling way to finish a challenge :)
      <br><br>
      Some other things I've done to boost up to 82500 points (Rising 6000 or so points in just today, clearing the
      entirety of HQ level 9 [no easy feat!], now beating 8th place in the final 2018 Girls Go Cyberstart competition [
      though I don't know how that translates to the GHSCC], and being 72.98% done [181/248 total challenges] with
      Cyberstart
      America) include Steganography with binwalk, more reverse engineering, and two particularly fun challenges that
      required some fun maneuvering:
      <br>
      <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="picture_files/cyber/find+grep=king.PNG">
      <br>^Here, I had to ssh into a foreign system and find a nondescript file that was created November 22nd, 2015 at
      20:00 (with no other information). After multiple tries and research, I found that I could use the deadly "find |
      grep" combo once again :) <br>
      <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="picture_files/cyber/find_the_img_in_elfs_p1..PNG">
      <br>^The next challenge (the one I'm most proud of, and have probably cheesed/circumvented the hardest) required
      me to
      ssh into a remote system (remember, this gets rid of most fancy tools on your home system), and find an image file
      in a ginormous mix of junk files (with all of the files ends stripped).
      <br><br>
      This was no beginner level challenge, and you couldn't just cheesily use "strings" or "grep" to find some string
      that searched the file system for 'flag:' in one of the files, as the flag is in the actual rendered image. So,
      instead, I cheesily used "file -i *" to find the odd one out in the folder with all the junk files in it. That was
      part one of the challenge...
      <br>
      <img style="width: 70%; height: auto;" src="picture_files/cyber/find_the_img_in_elfs_p2_results.PNG">
      <br>
      ^Part two of the challenge required me actually rendering the image file to get the flag. But, because I was ssh'd
      into a limited remote system, it wasn't as easy as opening it with xdg-open, right clicking on it, or using an
      image viewer. So, I had to go throught he process of learning how to use the "scp" command to go from my home
      system, input the exact location of the file I just found with "file -i *" on the remote system, and take it back
      to my home system, where I could then render it with xdg-open. Voilà, the flag is the serial number (SN:0207F9) :)

      <h3><u>OSINT-FR and DLI:</u></h3>
      <a href="https://osintfr.com/en/home/">OSINT-FR Home Page Link</a><br>
      I joined a global community of people curious about OSINT, both beginners and (primarily) super-whiz professionals
      and cyber ninjas, who do everything from develop powerful tools, share resources (online courses, neat articles,
      etc), tackle issues (e.g. disinformation, child abuse), and more! Au moins, ils parlent Français, et je peux les
      utiliser pour l'améliorer (particulierement avec la vocabulaire de Cybersécurité, et le web).
      <br><br>
      I also found some free resources online due to some OSINT of my own :)
      <br>Those being free "FSI" (Foreign Service Institute) and "DLI" (Defense Language Institute) resources online for
      French, Spanish, and a myriad of other languages. I researched and judged the DLI course to suit my needs more,
      and will be partaking in that for the foreseeable future (it's designed to be 15-20 work weeks of 6 hour class
      days on the language).

      <h3><u>Fall 2023 NCL CTF:</u></h3>
      <a href="https://nationalcyberleague.org/">NCL Home Page Link</a><br>
      Having participated in the Spring and Fall 2021 Individual Games, and the Fall 2021 Team Game, I can tell you that
      NCL is no joke. It has beginner to ultra-hard challenges in OSINT, Log Analysis, Network Traffic Analysis,
      Cryptography, Scanning, Forensics, Password Cracking, Enumeration and Exploitation, and Web Application Security
      (website hacking). This is going to be quite the competition, with me knowing much, much, MUCH more than I did
      than the last time I participated in this CTF. It's going to be fun :)

      <h2><i>June 29th, 2023: The GHSCC CTF, Cyberstart America, Bruteforce Hacking, and fun :)</i></h2>
      <p>
        <img style=" width: 60%; height: auto;" src="picture_files/cyber/hydra_attack.jpg"><br>
        Over the last few days (in addition to lots and lots of Eagle Rank work), I've been brushing up on my cyber
        skills in the <a href="https://ghscc-michigan.cyberstart.com/">"Michigan Governor's High School Cyber
          Challenge"</a> (GHSCC [run on the Cyberstart America platform]).
        <br>
        I had a lot of extra points from previous Cyberstart America seasons (where I scored high enough to gain access
        to the NCSF CTF, then won access to the SEC275: Foundations course from the SANS Institute [then passing the
        final exam, becoming certified]), but through the past couple of days I've jumped from 30,000 or so points, to
        over 52,000 points (each challenge at the levels I'm currently playing at are 600-700 points).
        <br>In the GHSCC, the top 10 teams (I'm flying solo :) ) in the Cyberstart Game, when the season ends, will win
        access to the 2023 SANS Core NetWars Cyber Range//CTF (which I have a keen eye upon winning [not really for any
        good reason, except it's {hopefully} more intense than anything I've done in a cyber competition before]). I
        looked up previous high scores from Cyberstart America to see how many points I needed to earn to be
        competitive, and found this photo: <br><img style="width: 50%; height:auto;"
          src="https://its.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cyberstart-Round-2-5.png"><br>
        <br>From doing socket programming with Python, encoding and decoding, decrypting, website hacking, brute
        force password hacking with Hydra (referencing the photo at the top of this post), brute force zipfile cracking
        and directory scanning with Python scripts, to SQL and command injection, I've been putting in the work.

        <br><br><br>21:40 - I just found the <a
          href="https://medium.com/girls-go-cyberstart/top-100-overall-final-e232859e1913">final list</a> for a series
        of Cyberstart ranking lists I found earlier, and this is suddenly terrifying. Top score is 117,700 (approx 170
        challenges, give or take a few), and score ten is 75,900 (DANG). I have a lot more work ahead of me ;-; (but, as
        always, <i>"we do not do these things because they are easy; we do them, because they are hard."</i>)

        Finally got around to making my Cybersecurity-blog-esque page on my personal website! This page will show you
        what sorts of things I've been up to in the field of Cybersecurity / IT (competing in CTFs, creating projects,
        cracking boxes in THM, etc.) <br> I'll think that I will also include a linked page that has a bunch of tools
        and resources you can go to (e.g. <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/">Cyberchef</a>, the <a
          href="https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier">Boxentriq cipher identifier</a>, and <a
          href="https://www.hackerone.com/ethical-hacker/100-hacking-tools-and-resources">other
