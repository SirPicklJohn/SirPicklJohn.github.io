      <p>I really need to get this out there, now that I'm careening out of control and into a better life's view

            something/one train of thought, and regaining strong impulse-control</li>
          <li>STICK TO THE PLAN, if you had one. If not, RE-ASSESS GOALS and PLAN (this would also be the MOTIVATION

            physical prowess or mastery in certain skills, living a life in the Swiss Alps and having legitimately best
            friends who don't speak English).</li>

          <li>STAY HEALTHY AND LIVE (i.e. perform sustainability checks and constantly micro-adjust, and do things to
            not become a slave to work and actually live the life you want, AFTER you've gotten to a comfortable stride

        <i><u>INTELLIGENCE, INTJ, General Productivity</u></i>

        <br><br>In the morning and before 14:21 - Used website and <a
          href="https://personal-website.aydenparsons.repl.co/intj.html">
          INTJ blog creation ("tl;dr a truly smart person enhancing his
          smarts, smartly") to springboard, using <a
            href="https://games.cdn.famobi.com/html5games/c/civilizations-wars-all-stars/v130/?fg_domain=play.famobi.com&fg_aid=A1000-111&fg_uid=2001681a-0f53-4691-9318-04e419ac7c0c&fg_pid=e37ab3ce-88cd-4438-9b9c-a37df5d33736&fg_beat=823&original_ref=">Civilization
            Wars</a> (the flash-type), Mastermind (<a href="https://webgamesonline.com/mastermind/">mastermind</a>, <a
            href="https://telehack.com/">telehack</a>),
          <a href="https://personal-website.aydenparsons.repl.co/cards.html">poker squares (3 games, 52 [high score], 37
            [messed up great opportunities], and 55 [high score])</a> and reading
          up on <a href="https://www.xpersonalitytest.com/intj">INTJ's</a>, <a
            href="https://www.brainzilla.com/logic/zebra/movies-night/">Zebra Puzzles</a> (just learned this was a
          thing), and finally <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/101392008/">ERS</a> (medium mode [difficulty 2],
          and
          this was super hard [didn't play until win, because that would take forever, which is exciting] even with
          memorizing up to three pairs at one time [had great momentum at a point and was slowly building, but then I
          messed up and threw that advantage away]). <br>Oh yeah, after my first poker squares game, I planned the rest
          of the day very well/intelligently (I'll include an image of it later on so I don't have to explain its
          subsections and divisions).

          <br><br>Now, at this point in the day, I'm much smarter (weird way of saying it, which is why "smart mode
          activated" is what I've been using here) and <i><b><u>completely "mentally warmed up".</u></b></i>

          <br><br>Examples (of the passive benefits of being mentally warmed up):
          <br>When jumping over the couch and onto the cushions, in mid-air I could observe the couch cushion being
          halfway off the couch and that if I hit it, it would give out and I could fall, and then adjusted my feet in
          the split second I was in air to help avoid that.
          <br>In doing this work, I'm staying mindful of my focus, so that if it slips due to the music or something
          else, I'll stop that thing and force myself back onto my train of thought. (more mindfulness than logic, but
          still helped out by my warmup [how secluded are those ideas from each other, if at all?])
          Doing my usual "passively seeing the core ideas behind everything", like doing pushups and knowing that blood
          and oxygen is going to that area, I'm doing them so quickly and easily because I'm doing them with speed and
          that's just how muscle elasticity works (relative to doing them slow), and just being quicker.
          <br>Being able to listen to French music (Ichon - La Vie) and interpret while writing this sentence out (THAT
          is a clear indicator that I am mentally fast, and in a high mental activity period, kind of like the first and
          only time I was high [though not quite so dramatic and crazy, and induced by mental warmups and exercise, not
          weed]).
          <br>Now I just want to do this whole process much quicker in the future (which is what my whole INTJ portion
          of the website is for).

      <h2><i>June 22nd, 2023, 22:46</i></h2>
      <p>
        (warning, i'm only halfway mentally here while writing this)
        <br>This was a little bit of a spur-of-the-moment idea to do this (create this page), this late. I've had the
        idea in the past to create a website that is all of the "smart things" and living life in a super analyzed,
        intelligent manner with all the information of life at your disposal, but this is the idea coming to fruition
        (even if as a hidden [slightly-obscured] HTML page in my personal website not many people are going to see, at
        least for awhile, anyways). <a href="https://www.xpersonalitytest.com/intj">I labelled it as "INTJ", because
          that is my Myer-Briggs, and apparently it's very
          rare, and those types of people have a very analytical and intelligent stereotype (which [this is the key
          purpose of the label] makes it easier to explain to people than fumbling around with "this is for being smart
          and living an analyzed life").</a>
        <br><br>tl;dr <i>I am an INTJ, and this page represents a truly smart person enhancing their smarts, smartly</i>
        <br><br><b style="font-weight:900">This website is going to be a repository of information, my in-depth
          analysis (WITH important
          conclusions as the key) on concepts, and anything else I feel will truly change my life, by means of the
          brain</b>
        <br><br>Who knows, this might be one of the most important things I do in my life.
        <br> <br> <i style="font-size:medium;font-weight:500">Thursday, 23:08 Ça va être amusant :)"</i>
        <br><br><br><br>My inspiration for coming back to this idea and (remember the actual definition of ultimate) of
        creating an
        ultimate knowledge repository was from seeing a YT short of telehack.com starwars (cool as heck from
        NetworkChuck), playing with it myself, and poking around in cool texts (I really liked the story in
        colossus.txt) and whatever else, until I came across "mastermind.bas", which was just the game Mastermind (which
        I've had on my shelf since childhood, but NEVER opened once).
        <br>Turns out it's an incredibly logical game (that's the whole point: doing [good] experiments to win and guess
        the combination), and I had fun playing it, and putting myself back into a logical state of mind (like how
        warming up the body works, I was warming up my brain with logic, something I've played with in the past, but
        never saved down hardcore until this web-page [I'm excited]).
        <br> The first thing I want to do with this page is create a repo of "daily mental warmups", which sharpen
        logic, strategy, maybe motivation (maybe I can skip certain things if I don't need it), and other stuff. Maybe
        it shouldn't be "warmups", but merely "a repository of things to get yourself in a smart state of mind and on
        track"? <i>Questions like these and their answers is what this part of my site is for.</i>
        <br><br> EXAMPLE REPOSITORY (to get the idea across if nothing has yet): <i><u
            style="font-weight:900">Influencing ( Controlling :) )
            Mental States and the Brain:</u></i> (side note, this title needs to be chosen very carefully and generally,
        as I
        could totally <s>of</s> (have) ([Michigan accent, my apologies]) started saying "maximizing productivity", which
        would cause an immense amount of redundancy and
        limitation)
        <br>This repo would teach you that topic in an explanatory/teaching format, with original conclusions (and
        research) while referencing many things like the <a
          href="https://blog.fentress.com/blog/the-eudaimonia-machine-a-space-concept-for-the-21st-century">"Eudaimonia
          Machine"</a>, Classical Conditioning and
        Pavlov's Dogs...
      <div style="font-size: 8;">(do you think that Pavlov wanted/was prompted to feed the dogs when the bell
        rang? [I only phrase
        that as a question due to
        the fact that I originally saw that idea as a question, and have that mental connection {I love the fact that
        memory EXCLUSIVELY works in connections}], ANYWAYS different topic that WILL be covered elsewhere here on this
        site])</div>
      <br>
      <div style="font-size:14pt">
        <!--reset font size now that I'm out of that tangent-->
        <a href="https://zenhabits.net/self-discipline/">discipline (and developing it [also does discipline belong in
          this list, even
          if related?])</a>, original research and
        conclusions on hardcore mindfulness (awareness) to do "surgically alter the current state of body/mind" to do
        things like
        "forcibly dig yourself out of a mental slough/depressing rut", "meditate yourself a boner", "thinking yourself
        out of overstimulation and/or depression", and <i>wild</i> things like that (no link, just really cool
        self-experience and experimentation), attaching mental states/emotions/prompts to things (much like a mind
        palace, and why the Eudaimonia machine works)...and the <a
          href="https://www.thebioneer.com/home-batcaves/">Bioneer's
          research already done on this
          topic! ("batcaves" and the "productive workspace")</a> (there is a strong reason I love this guy.)
