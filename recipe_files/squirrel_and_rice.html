    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p>
    <ol style="font-size:18px;">
      <li>Rice:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in heavy, medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in cumin, cloves, and bay leaf, and briefly
          cook</li>
        <li>Add onion, garlic, and red pepper (or red pepper substitute seasonings). Cook until onion is tender.</li>
        <li>Stir in rice, and add water/broth and salt.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. (Now would be a good time to
          butcher/prepare meat if you haven't already)</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, and let steam/sit for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fluff rice, remove bay leaf (and cloves, if you can find them), and stir in peanuts.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Meat:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut meat into easily-cookable strips (super small pieces are perfectly okay if you have them, and don't
          leave pieces strung together)</li>
        <li>Oil up pieces of meat, season them with salt, pepper, and garlic (or seasonings of choice), and put them in
          pan at medium to medium-high heat (multiple batches is fine, and allows for experimentation)</li>
        <li>When one side is finished cooking, flip pieces, and sprinkle some more seasoning on as desired</li>
        <li>When finished cooking (they don't take that long), put the pieces into your bowl of rice, and stir them in.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy :)</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
